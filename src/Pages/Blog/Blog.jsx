              1. What are the different ways to manage a state in a React
              application?
            </p>
            <p className="lg:text-lg text-sm">
              <span className="font-semibold">Answer: </span> <br /> Stateful
              Components (Class Components): Class components in React have a
              built-in state object, which allows them to manage internal
              component-specific data. State can be initialized in the
              constructor and updated using the setState() method. This approach
              is suitable for managing state within individual components.
              <br />
              Functional Components with Hooks: With the introduction of React
              Hooks, functional components can now manage local state using the
              useState hook. This allows functional components to have stateful
              behavior without using class components. Hooks provide a simpler
              and more concise way to manage state, making functional components
              more powerful and easier to understand. <br />
              Context API: The Context API in React provides a way to share data
              between components without having to explicitly pass props down
              through the component tree. It allows you to create a global state
              that can be accessed by any component within the context provider.
              This is particularly useful for managing application-wide state or
              sharing data that is needed by multiple components at different
              levels of the component tree.

              2. How does prototypical inheritance work?
            </p>
            <p className="lg:text-lg text-sm">
              <span className="font-semibold">Answer: </span> <br />
              Prototypical inheritance is a fundamental concept in JavaScript,
              where objects can inherit properties and behaviors from other
              objects. In JavaScript, each object has an internal link to
              another object called its prototype. When you access a property or
              method on an object, JavaScript first checks if the object itself
              has that property or method. If not, it looks up the prototype
              chain, which is a series of linked objects, until it finds the
              property or method. When you create an object in JavaScript, you
              can specify another object as its prototype. If a property or
              method is not found on the object itself, JavaScript will look for
              it on its prototype, and then on the prototype's prototype, and so
              on, until it reaches the end of the prototype chain.

              3. What is a unit test? Why should we write unit tests?
            </p>
            <p className="lg:text-lg text-sm">
              <span className="font-semibold">Answer: </span> <br />
              A unit test is a type of software testing where individual units
              or components of a software application are tested in isolation to
              ensure they behave as expected. These units can be functions,
              methods, or classes. Unit tests are typically automated and focus
              on small, specific parts of the codebase. We should write unit
              tests for several reasons: <br />
              <span className="font-semibold">
                1. Verification of Individual Units:
              </span>{" "}
               Unit tests allow developers to verify that each unit of
              code behaves correctly in isolation, ensuring that it produces the
              expected output for a given input.
              <br />
              <span className="font-semibold">
                2. Early Detection of Bugs:
              </span>{" "}
              By identifying and fixing issues at the unit level,
              developers can catch bugs early in the development process,
              preventing them from propagating to other parts of the
              application.

                3. Facilitate Refactoring:
              </span>{" "}
              Unit tests provide a safety net when refactoring code. They
              ensure that changes to one part of the codebase do not
              unintentionally break functionality elsewhere.

                4.btn-disabled Documentation and Code Understanding:
              </span>{" "}
              Unit tests serve as living documentation for the codebase,
              helping developers understand how individual components are
              intended to work and how they interact
              <span className="font-semibold">
                with each other. Improved Code Quality:
              </span>{" "} Writing unit tests encourages writing modular, testable code
              with clear separation of concerns, leading to higher code quality
              and maintainability.
              <br />
              <span className="font-semibold">5. Regression Testing:</span>{" "}
              Unit tests act as a form of regression testing, ensuring
              that existing functionality continues to work as expected even as
              the codebase evolves over time.

              4.React vs. Angular vs. Vue?
            </p>
            <p className="lg:text-lg text-sm">
              <span className="font-semibold">Answer: </span> <br />
              <span className="font-semibold">1. React:</span> <br /> React,
              developed by Facebook, employs a component-based architecture
              where UIs are constructed by composing reusable components. It
              prioritizes efficiency through the use of a virtual DOM for quick
              updates. With a thriving ecosystem including tools like React
              Router and Redux, React is favored for its simplicity and
              adaptability, catering to projects of varying scales.
              <span className="font-semibold"><br />b. Angular:</span>  Angular,
              backed by Google, is a comprehensive framework tailored for
              enterprise-level applications. Following the Model-View-Controller
              (MVC) pattern, it offers features like two-way data binding and
              dependency injection, coupled with a robust CLI for streamlined
              project management. Angular's opinionated nature suits projects
              requiring strict adherence to guidelines, particularly in
              corporate settings.
              <span className="font-semibold"><br />3. Vue.js:</span> Vue.js, a
              progressive framework, amalgamates the best attributes of React
              and Angular. Known for its simplicity and incremental adoption,
              Vue.js provides features like single-file components and reactive
              data binding. Its gentle learning curve and extensive ecosystem
              make it an attractive choice for developers of all proficiencies,
              particularly for its ease of integration with existing projects.
              In essence, React thrives on simplicity and adaptability, Angular
              excels in robustness for large-scale applications, while Vue.js
              strikes a balance between the two, offering simplicity and ease of
              adoption. The selection among them hinges on project requisites,
              team competencies, and individual inclinations.
